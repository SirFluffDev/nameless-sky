# Nameless Sky
A top-down sandbox game.

It's still extremely early in development, so don't expect anything crazy as of yet.

### Plan
> My goal for the game is to create a hybrid of the sandbox and beat-em-up genres. Kind of like how Terraria's gameplay feels.

### Progress
> The only real things I've finished are the rendering and input system. I've implemented a basic collision system, but it's very primitive and could definitely be improved.

### Ideas
> These are a few of the things I'm planning to implement:
> - Dungeons throughout the world, with dungeon crawler style gameplay and unique bosses
> - Skill tree and RPG-like leveling system
> - NPCs and villages (maybe)
> - Character customization
> - Lore???

I've got a lot of stuff to do outside of gamedev right now, so don't expect this to update frequently.

Cheers!
